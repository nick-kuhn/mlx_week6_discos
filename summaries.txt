TITLE: How can we capture the concpet of Value and understand it with AI?
CONTENT: So, to go back to the beginning. First, there was Value. Earlier in the course we discussed the idea of embedding or vectorizing personal values or organizational values. What might a meaningful vector representation of a human's values constitute. For example, if we could create a local, explainable* machine learning system for teaching a Model values â€“ this could be useful for a number of reasons: recruitment, team building, leadership and strategy, organizational culture. Ultimately, having a meaningful, living and growing representation of an organization's values is helpful for doing whatever it is you are trying to. Moon landings, teaching children, curing cancer, running a church, running a local council, starting a start-up or running a country.
Summary: Value is an abstract concept that is difficult to express in machine learning.
