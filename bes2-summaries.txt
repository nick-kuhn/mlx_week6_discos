TITLE: The problem with reward magnitudes in different games
CONTENT: Let me ask you this - we're going to play Atari games and we're going to get some scores. Can you tell me the magnitude of those scores? Can you give me a sense of how big the score can be in these games that you play with your friends, like Pong games and all those things? Probably about 7000, depending on the game. Some games are 0 or 1 if you win or lose, but some games can be several thousand points. We have a problem - those numbers are going to be very fluctuating, and this might not seem like a big deal, but I can do some feature engineering. I can take min-max scaling and say that the maximum score in Pong is 1 million, so 1 million becomes 1, 0 becomes 0, and 500,000 becomes 0.5. But then you have another game, and remember that we want a function that works for all of them. What I'm trying to suggest is that those scores are probably not good for training a general system.
Summary: The scores of different games are probably not good for training a general system.

TITLE: The variance problem in reinforcement learning rewards
CONTENT: Not only are the score ranges inconsistent, but sometimes when you hit the jackpot in one of your questions, you answer perfectly, and the reward model says this is jackpot - you get a lot of points for this. But then many other examples, you kind of do badly, or maybe you do well but don't get rewarded. So when we do training in batches, we're going to have some scores that are really high and some scores that are really low, and this is a problem. How do we call this problem? The issue is high variance. They're not really well distributed - almost nothing is uniform. When you train the policy, the policy is not going to generate one answer at a time, it's going to generate 20 answers at a time, and then you batch them. But then the batch might have high variance in the rewards, and that's not going to be very stable for training.
Summary: You're going to have scores that are really high and some scores that are really low, and this is a problem.

TITLE: Why high variance rewards hurt training even when unbiased
CONTENT: If you think about the average of all scores for every answer, that's still unbiased, because on average, if you take all the things that you sampled and divide by how many times you queried the policy, that's still an unbiased estimate of how the policy is performing. But most of this is going to be super noisy, and as we move to the next stage, we're trying to reduce this variance in the rewards. We need the model to try to predict how it's going to do. So the model is playing the game, and when the model finishes playing the game, we get a reward. This reward might be very big or very small and we're going to use this reward. We're not going to trust that the reward is stable because it's very fluctuating potentially. What we're going to do is ask the model itself to tell us, how do you think you did?
Summary: You can't trust that the rewards are stable because they're fluctuating

TITLE: Using the model's own predictions to reduce variance
CONTENT: We're going to ask the model, can you guess how you did? It doesn't even know how it did yet. We're just going to ask it, can you guess how you did? Why do we do this? It's because over time, the model will learn to predict how well it performed. So instead of having a reward that fluctuates between 0 and 5 million, which is going to cause huge variance, the model will learn to predict the score. When the actual score is 500 million, the model might predict it thinks it did 495 million. So now the difference is only 5 million instead of the full 500 million. I'm reducing the variance by asking the model itself how it thinks it did - not how it actually did, but how it thinks it did. This is exactly what the advantage function does - it measures how much better the model is doing compared to what the model was thinking it was doing.
Summary: Ask the model how it thinks it did, it will tell you, and use that to reduce variance in the reward

TITLE: Introduction to the advantage function and actor-critic methods
CONTENT: What we're going to say is that we're going to create a new function called the advantage function. We're going to create a new reward for each token that incorporates this variance reduction. We're going to call this delta, and delta is the reward that we get from the environment, minus what the model thinks it's doing. How do we know what the model thinks it's doing? This is a little bit tricky, so stay with me. This is where we introduce the value function. What we do is we pass the model the current state and all future states, and the value model will output a prediction of how well it thinks it will do from this point forward. We call this the value function, and we're going to have a loss function just for the value model, because the value model has to learn to predict how the policy is doing. This is called actor-critic - we have an actor (the policy) and a critic (the value model).
Summary: This is the new function that we're going to incorporate into our model. We're going to use it to update our policy and our value function.

TITLE: The recursive definition of the advantage function
CONTENT: We have a recursive function definition. We say that delta for that token is the reward at time t, plus the value at time t+1 (which is the predicted value for the next state), minus the value at time t (which is the predicted value for the current state). So we get the immediate reward, plus what we expect to get in the future, minus what we thought we would get from the current state. This gives us a measure of how much better or worse we did compared to our expectations. Clearly we're going to have a loss function just for the value model, because the value model has to learn to predict how the policy is performing. At first the value model won't be very good, but imagine that over time it learns to make accurate predictions about future rewards.
Summary: A recursive definition of the advantage function.

Original: TOPIC: reinforcement_learning
TITLE: The advantage function formula and generalized advantage estimation
CONTENT: We also define A_t, which is the advantage at time t. The advantage function is the formula where we also have lambda and gamma, where lambda is something like a temporal projection parameter that looks into the future. The advantage function takes the immediate reward prediction error and combines it with future predictions in a weighted way. Then finally, what we do is take our reward for that specific token and we calculate it as the advantage function. That's how we're going to calculate the final reward signal that gets used for training. The advantage function helps us determine not just whether we got a good reward, but whether we got a better reward than we expected to get, which is much more informative for learning.
Summary: The advantage function takes the immediate reward prediction error and combines it with future predictions in a weighted way.

TITLE: Why we need sophisticated reward shaping in language models
CONTENT: Remember what we are trying to solve here - we have rewards that can be very high or very low, and we need to spread that reward across the whole sequence. But we can't do a naive spreading where we take 500 million points and just distribute them equally. We can't say the first token gets 1 million reward, the second token gets 1 million reward, and so on until we've distributed all 500 million. The gradient would just blow up. So what we say is that at each time step, we're going to ask the model, how do you think you're doing at this point? What do you think should be the score here? And at the same time, we spread the actual score through the whole answer. But simultaneously, we calculate what the model thinks should be the score at that specific time step.
Summary: We need sophisticated reward shaping in language models, not simple spreading of rewards across the whole sequence.

Original: TOPIC: reinforcement_learning
TITLE: The simultaneous training of value prediction and reward shaping
CONTENT: We track two things simultaneously - we spread the reward across tokens, but we also calculate what the model thinks should be the score at each specific time step. So we can track the difference between how much the model is actually doing versus how much the model predicted it would do. The only reason we want to do this is dimension reduction - we want the model to predict that when it gets 500 million points, it should have predicted something close to 500 million, so that the difference is only 10 million instead of the full 500 million. This way the gradients don't blow up as much. So we're not just shaping the reward, we're shaping the advantage, and the advantage calculation is a big thing in and of itself. This is what makes the training stable and allows the model to learn effectively from sparse, high-variance rewards.
Summary: We're tracking the difference between what the model predicts and what the model actually does, and the difference is only 10% of what the model predicted.

Original: TOPIC: reinforcement_learning
TITLE: The complexity of temporal difference learning in language models
CONTENT: The advantage calculation involves looking into the future because we need to estimate what rewards we expect to get from future states. The value model has to learn to predict not just immediate rewards, but the expected cumulative reward from any given state. This is where the temporal difference learning comes in - we're constantly updating our estimates of how good different states are based on the actual outcomes we observe. It's a bit tricky because we're using the model's own predictions to train itself, which creates a bootstrapping problem. The value model starts out making random predictions, but over time it learns to make accurate predictions about future rewards, which makes the advantage calculations more meaningful and the overall training more stable.
Summary: The advantage calculation in language models involves using the model's own predictions to train itself, which creates a bootstrapping problem and makes the learning process more complex and stable.
