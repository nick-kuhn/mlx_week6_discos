TITLE: Complete guide to RLHF training from fundamentals to implementation
CONTENT: This comprehensive overview covers the complete process of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for language models. We start with the fundamental problem: we don't have enough data for supervised fine-tuning, so we need tricks to make models learn from limited examples. Reinforcement learning, developed in the 1950s, uses agents that take actions, receive rewards, and learn through trial and error. The dream is that this could lead to AGI, as shown by systems like AlphaGo that achieve superhuman performance. Recent research shows RL models are more efficient than base models - while base models give useful answers only 20% of the time, RL models succeed 40% of the time, doubling efficiency. However, there's a trade-off: asking a base model 128 times can beat an RL model asked once, because RL training may cause catastrophic forgetting. The RLHF architecture uses three models: a policy model (the main language model), a reward model (modified to output scalar scores instead of next tokens), and a value model (policy model with an additional head). The reward model is trained using pairwise comparisons with a loss function that maximizes the difference between winning and losing answers. The core challenge is reward shaping - how to distribute a single reward score across all tokens in a sequence. We use KL divergence regularization to prevent the policy from moving too far from the reference model, avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Only the last token gets the full reward signal, while other tokens get regularization rewards. The advantage function reduces variance by comparing actual performance to predicted performance. We ask the model to predict how well it thinks it did, then compare that to actual results. This creates a bootstrapping system where the model learns to critique itself. Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) works backwards from the end token, discounting future rewards and combining actual observed rewards with predicted future rewards. The value function must estimate both current performance and future expectations. PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) evolved from game RL to language models when OpenAI applied their existing algorithms to language tasks. The algorithm handles the on-policy vs off-policy problem by clipping policy updates to prevent drastic changes. PPO uses three loss components: policy loss (with clipped advantages), value loss (mean squared error), and entropy loss (encouraging exploration). The training reuses examples multiple times but clips changes to stay within 5% of the original policy. Ultimately, reinforcement learning doesn't add new capabilities to language models - it just improves sample efficiency and preference alignment. The base model already has all the knowledge from pre-training; RL just teaches it to surface preferred answers more reliably. However, PPO has many hyperparameters that make it complex to tune, often requiring more art than science to get right.
Summary: a range of -0.1 to 0.1. This limits the range of changes, preventing overfitting. PPO uses a fixed number of steps and a decay rate to ensure the agent doesn't get stuck in suboptimal policies.

TITLE: The technical mechanics of variance reduction in RLHF
CONTENT: The variance problem is central to RLHF training. Different games and tasks have wildly different reward scales - some give 0/1 rewards, others give thousands of points. This creates high variance that makes training unstable. When training in batches, some examples get very high rewards while others get very low rewards, creating an optimization nightmare. Even though the average is unbiased, the high variance makes gradients unreliable. The solution is sophisticated variance reduction through the advantage function. Instead of using raw rewards, we ask the model to predict how well it thinks it performed, then compare that prediction to actual results. If the actual reward is 500 million and the model predicted 495 million, the advantage is only 5 million instead of the full 500 million. This dramatically reduces variance. The advantage function is defined recursively: advantage at time t equals the immediate reward plus the predicted value of the next state minus the predicted value of the current state. This creates a temporal difference learning system where we constantly update our estimates of state values. The value model must learn two things: how good the current state is, and what rewards to expect in the future. This is challenging because we're using the model's own predictions to train itself, creating a bootstrapping problem. Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) adds sophistication by working backwards from the end token and combining actual observed rewards for a few steps with predicted rewards for the rest. We discount future rewards because they're worth less and could be high variance. The value model is trained with mean squared error to minimize the difference between predicted and actual rewards. This allows us to reuse training examples multiple times through multiple backpropagation steps. The simultaneous training of reward spreading and value prediction creates a complex but effective system. We spread the reward across all tokens while calculating what the model thinks the score should be at each position. This dual tracking allows us to measure the difference between prediction and reality, keeping gradients stable even with high-variance rewards. The result is a training system that can learn from sparse, high-variance rewards while maintaining stability.
Summary: RLHF training creates high variance that makes gradients unreliable. Variance reduction through advantage function and GAE allows us to spread rewards across all tokens and keep gradients stable.

TITLE: PPO implementation details and the art of hyperparameter tuning
CONTENT: PPO's implementation reveals the sophisticated engineering behind modern RLHF. The algorithm emerged when OpenAI applied their game-playing RL expertise to language models in 2017-2019. This "hammer and nail" approach worked surprisingly well when GPT-3 demonstrated the potential of large language models. The core innovation is handling the on-policy vs off-policy problem. When we first generate an answer and backpropagate, we're on-policy because the same model version created the answer. But when we backpropagate multiple times on the same answer, we're off-policy because the model has changed. PPO solves this with conservative policy updates - we clip changes to allow only 5% movement from the original policy. We calculate the ratio between new and old policy probabilities, clip it to a narrow range, and take the minimum between clipped and unclipped versions. This prevents the policy from changing too drastically. The complete loss function has three components: policy loss (using clipped advantages), value loss (mean squared error for variance reduction), and entropy loss (encouraging exploration). Each component has coefficients allowing us to weight their relative importance. The entropy term is crucial because our heavy constraints on policy movement could make the model too conservative, so we explicitly encourage diverse responses. Training involves multiple backpropagation steps on the same examples, which normally causes catastrophic forgetting. But the clipping mechanism prevents this by constraining how much the policy can change from its original version. The value model starts from the same checkpoint as the policy and learns to predict expected rewards. The complexity comes from PPO's many hyperparameters: discount factor, lambda for temporal weighting, epsilon for clipping, number of replay steps, learning rates, and coefficients for each loss component. Tuning these requires extensive experimentation and domain expertise - it's more art than science. Each parameter affects training dynamics in subtle ways, and getting the right combination often requires understanding the deep interactions between components. This complexity is why PPO can be tricky to implement correctly, but when properly tuned, it provides stable training for preference alignment in language models.
Summary: PPO's implementation reveals the intricate engineering behind modern RLHF. Understanding its hyperparameters, training dynamics, and tuning strategies requires deep expertise in RL, machine learning, and preference alignment.
